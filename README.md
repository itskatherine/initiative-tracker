# Initiative tracker for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition

## Introduction

In combat encounters in [Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (D&D)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/introduction), players and enemies work out the turn order
each rolling a 20 sided dice, and adding their initiative bonus.

The players (and enemies they may be fighting) are then ordered by their initiative, and combat
progresses in that order. This initiative tracker is a tool to help those running combats to keep track
of initiative and organise players turns.

## Current features

1. Dice roller
2. Ability to add initiative bonus
3. Order button, to order the players by descending initiative
4. Player name input
5. Delete button to delete players and enemies from initiative

## Future features

1. Ability to manually enter players initiatives without rolling (if player wants to use a physical dice).
